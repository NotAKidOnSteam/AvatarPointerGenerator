# AvatarPointerGenerator

A tool to automatically generate default pointers for humanoid ChilloutVR avatars.

The tool can be found under `Tools/Avatar Pointer Generator`.

- Currently will generate Head, Hands, and Feet colliders for humanoid avatars. 
- Support for Unity undo system. 
- There are no generic "Hand" or "Foot" colliders.

The tool follows the naming scheme for [HumanBodyBones](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/HumanBodyBones.html) in Unity.
